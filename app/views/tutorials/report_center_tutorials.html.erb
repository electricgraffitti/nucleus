                Generate leadership-level reports with some of the deepest and most particular search parameters available. You can also schedule reports to be output on the particular day you’ll need one. Or, if you need a reoccurring report to be generated, schedule daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly reports that will be delivered directly to your inbox in your preferred file format.

                Create a report the second you need one, or in advance of when you will. Nucleus’ robust, leadership-level reports are simple to create and can be output as a PDF, Excel or CSV file.<br/><br/>
                To run a one-time report, under "Selection" select the "Type" of report you need from the drop-down menu. Then select a "Category" or "Sub-category" and include a "Description" (if necessary). Then, under "Scheduling" click "Generate Now", "Once" and designate either a "Star Date" or "Time", then click  "End Date", "End After XX Occurences" or "No End Date". Be sure to fill out the "Email" field to designate where the report should be sent. Under "Parameters" use the calendars to select a  "Trigger Start Date" and "Trigger End Date".  Include "Minimum total patients" and "Minimum total paid" to get even more out of your reports. Finally, select the file type you would like your report generated as, and click on "Search".<br/><br/>
