                Once your ideas have been voted on by users and approved by HCI, they’ll be tracked under the "Ideas in Development" tab. Our engineers will keep an ongoing status log of all updates that can include changes made, anticipated completion dates and much more. As the ideas are completed and implemented into Nucleus, we’ll store them within our “Implemented Ideas” for all the world to see.
